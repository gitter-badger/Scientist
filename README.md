Perl module inspired by https://github.com/github/scientist ( http://githubengineering.com/scientist/ )


Introduction

This module is inspired by the Scientist ruby code released by GitHub under the MIT license in 2015/2016.

In February 2016 I started writing this Perl module to bring similar ideas to Perl. 

Please get involved in this module; contact lancew@cpan.org with ideas, suggestions; support, etc.

This code is also released under the MIT license to match the original Ruby implementation.
